# Overview

This is a very simple program  written in C++, as a way for me to be inntroduced to the language and its syntax.
It takes in a text file from the user, and analyzes it in one of two ways:
1. Count the number of each letter in the file
2. Count the number of each word in the file

It is also capable of exporting the results to a file, for easy searching of the results (useful for larger files)

# Development Environment

I used VS code for this, with the official Microsoft extension and MinGW.

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) (for fact checking and errorr correction)

# Future Work

- The menu system is very basic, and doesn't do much error checking. If the user inputs a number to select an option, but one that isn't in the list of options, it just continues without doing anything.
- I think it would be cool to be able to find a specific word in the file, and have the program point to it, perhaps on which line it is. Again, useful for larger files.
- Manual text input processing would be another feature worth considering.
